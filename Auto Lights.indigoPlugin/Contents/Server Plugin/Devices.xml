<!-- If your plugin defines device types, you can define them here.

     Devices must specify their type (via the type attribute):

        relay (ON/OFF/STATUS)
        dimmer (ON/OFF/DIM/BRIGHTEN/SET BRIGHTNESS/STATUS)
        speedcontrol (ON/OFF/SET SPEED LEVEL/SET SPEED INDEX/INCREASE/DECREASE/STATUS)
        sensor (ON/OFF/STATUS)
        thermostat
        sprinkler
        custom

     The first six inherit states, actions and events from Indigo. You can
     also specify your own custom actions and additional states, if needed.

     All of the Device examples below specify the custom type and therefore
     must define their own states and actions. See the other example device
     plugins that illustrate overriding an existing native type (relay, dimmer,
     thermostat, etc.).

     Devices must also specify a unique type_id - so, for instance, if you define
     2 relay type devices then your plugin can distinguish between the two by
     the type_id.

<Devices>
    <Device type="custom" id="auto_lights_zone">
        <Name>Auto Lights Zone</Name>
        <!-- States removed in favor of dynamic device states -->
    </Device>
</Devices>
